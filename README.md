Hi,
This file contains html and css codes written during my learning period.
I learnt html and css through a YouTube video by Simon Bao. Link for the video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLYPEOW-UqZR1hGsIn6MiTg8MrSel_el4_&index=3
I did it in an easy pace, took a month to complete the video with all the exercises and challenges.
Completed a project at the end of this course which will be uploaded in a seperate folder.
As someone with no prior coding knowledge this was easy to follow and fun to learn!
Uploading here to keep track of my progress and maintain a repository online.
