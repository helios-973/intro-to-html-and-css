Hi,
This file contains html and css codes written during my learning period.
I learnt html and css through a YouTube video by Simon Bao. Link for the video - https://tinyurl.com/ye24c6en .
I did it in an easy pace, took a month to complete the video with all the exercises and challenges.
Completed a project at the end of this course which will be uploaded in a separate folder.
As someone with no prior coding knowledge this was easy to follow and fun to learn!
Uploading here to keep track of my progress and maintain a repository online.
